## Abstract
Deep learning techniques have been widely used in
autonomous driving systems for the semantic understanding of
urban scenes. However, they need a huge amount of labeled
data for training, which is difficult and expensive to acquire.
A recently proposed workaround is to train deep networks using
synthetic data, but the domain shift between real world and
synthetic representations limits the performance. In this work we
propose an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy to adapt a
synthetic supervised training to real world data. The proposed
learning strategy exploits two components: a standard supervised
learning on real world data and an adversarial learning module
that exploits both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real
data. Furthermore, we describe a simple method based on
Fourier Transforms for unsupervised domain adaptation aimed
to obtain better performances, whereby the discrepancy between
the source and target distributions is reduced by swapping the
low-frequency spectrum of one with the other.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to become familiar with the task of
Domain Adaptation applied to the Real-time Semantic Segmentation
networks. The student should understand the general approaches to perform
Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation and the main reason to apply
them to real-time networks
